### C# Script Documentation

With the tutorial, the user is shown a few things that can be done by the user. 

* Interact with a cube to play a video:

```csharp
public class PlayVideoOnTouch : MonoBehaviour {
  [SerializeField] public VideoPlayer videoPlayer;
  private bool videoStarted = false;
  private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider col) {
    // Check if the video has already started to avoid restarting it unnecessarily
    if (!videoStarted && videoPlayer != null) {
      videoPlayer.Play();
      videoStarted = true;
    }
  }
}
```

* Pick up, drop and throw objects:

This portion of the tutorial is done by utilizing the XR Grab Interactable component, which it is added to each object. Along with that, some objects have gravity component turned on, while others have gravity turned off.

* Hitting a golf ball with a club:

The script of this portion is somewhat complex, but in short there are two objects, the golf club and the golf ball, once the user picks up the golf club and swings it to the golf ball, the ball will detect the club and will behave as if it got hit with the club.
```csharp
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) {
  if (collision.collider.CompareTag("GolfClub") && !isAnimating) {
    StartCoroutine(MoveAlongArc());
  }
}
```

* These components work together to create a seamless and therapeutic VR experience, targeting the rehabilitation goals of improving motor skills and cognitive function. The following sections will detail the specific game objects and scripts utilized to bring Level 1 to life, including their functionalities and how they contribute to the rehabilitation objectives.

### C# Script Documentation

Tasks to be completed as user plays through the level:

1) "Head over to the counter with the bread and grab it."

To verify if the slice of bread has been picked up, we utilized the following script:
```csharp
// Check whether the bread has moved from starting position
breadUpdatePosition = breadSlice.transform.position.y; 
if (breadUpdatePosition - breadStartingPosition > 0.25 && !taskCompleted) {
  check1.material.color = checkColor; 
  // Play audio to let the user know they successfully did the task
  if (!audioSource.isPlaying) {
    audioSource.clip = completionSound;
    audioSource.Play();
  }
  taskCompleted = true;
}
```

2) "Locate the toaster and insert the slice of bread into it."

The toaster script is more complex than other scripts, but that is due to having a smooth animation. Script below has been shorten to show how the animation works:
```csharp
// Once the toaster recognizes the slice of bread, start the coroutine
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
  if (other.gameObject == breadOnCounter && !isToasting) {
    isToasting = true;
    StartCoroutine(ToastBreadAnimation());
  }
}

private IEnumerator ToastBreadAnimation() {
  // Code to animate the bread going up
  float elapsedTime = 0;
  Rigidbody rb = breadPlaceholder.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
  if (rb != null) {
    // Change kinematic to true to disable bread from clashing with toaster
    rb.isKinematic = true;
  }
  
  while (elapsedTime < toastingTime / 2) {
    breadPlaceholder.transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(breadDownPosition.position, breadUpPosition.position, elapsedTime / (toastingTime / 2));
    elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;
    yield return null;
  }
  
  if (rb != null) {
    // Disabling kinematics will allow the bread to fall due to gravity
    rb.isKinematic = false;
  }
}
```

3) "Now that you toasted it, plate it on the dining table."

```csharp
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
  // Check if the object colliding with the plate is tagged as "Toast".
  if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Toast")) {
    check3Box.material.color = checkColor;
    
    // Do a few changes to set the level as complete
    if (!levelCompleteText.activeSelf) {
      levelCompleteText.SetActive(true);
    }
    if (!finishCube.activeSelf) {
      finishCube.SetActive(true);
    }
  }
}
```

### C# Script Documentation

Tasks to be completed:

1) Open the refrigerator and grab the meatball to place it in the bowl next to the sink

Script to open door:
```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
  if (other.CompareTag("Player")) {
    if (!istrigger) { 
      myDoor.Play("BigDoorOpen", 0, 0.0f); 
      istrigger = true;    
    }
    else {
      myDoor.Play("BigDoorClose", 0, 0.0f);
      istrigger = false;
    }   
  }
}
```

A simple script that checks for an object tagged as Sausage:
```csharp
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider col) {
  if (col.CompareTag("Sausage")) {
    check1Box.material.color = checkColor; 
  }
}
```

2) Touch brown knob on stove to turn the burner on
```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider col) {
  if (col.CompareTag("Player")) {
    if (!istrigger) { 
      myKnob.Play("StoveKnobOn", 0, 0.0f); 
      objectRenderer.material.color = endColor;
      check2Box.material.color = checkColor; 
      istrigger = true;    
    }
    else {
      myKnob.Play("StoveKnobClose", 0, 0.0f);
      objectRenderer.material.color = startColor;
      check4Box.material.color = checkColor;
      istrigger = false;
    }
  }
}
```

3) Wait for meatball to cook
```csharp
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
  if (other.CompareTag("Sausage") && ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA(oldColor) != ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA(initialStoveColor)) {
    StartCoroutine(CookCoroutine());
  }
}

IEnumerator CookCoroutine() {
  yield return new WaitForSeconds(7);
  objectRenderer.material.color = cookedColor;
  check3Box.material.color = checkColor;
}
```

4) Touch brown knob on stove to turn the burner off
Utilizes the same script as turning the burner on, but if the stove is already turned on, once the user interacts with the knob, the stove will turn back to the original color.

5) Transfer the cooked meatball into the bowl to the left of the stove by grabbing the pan handle
Script compares the tag of the object to "Sausage", along with verifying the meatball has the same color as the cooked meatball.
```csharp
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider col) {
  if (col.CompareTag("Sausage") && ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA(sausageMaterial) == ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA(cookedColor)) {
    check1Box.material.color = check5Color; 
    if (!levelCompleteText.activeSelf) {
      levelCompleteText.SetActive(true);
    }
    if (!finishCube.activeSelf) {
      finishCube.SetActive(true);
    }
  }
}
```
